Using Python get the 100 (up to) most recent user handles who retweeted a tweet.

Uses the package https://github.com/bear/python-twitter

See retweets.py file for more details.

Note: you will not always get user details for everyone that retweets. This means the
number of user handles may be less than the amount reported on Twitter. Could this be 
because some accounts are protected?
